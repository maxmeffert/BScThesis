\section{Introduction}
This exposé\footnote{\url{http://www.softlang.org/info:expose}} outlines the thesis:
\begin{center}
\it
\thesis
\end{center}
for acquiring the degree Bachelor Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science.
The central topic of the thesis will be the study of traceability recovery in a megamodel governed environment, that is \megal, a modeling language for such models. Furthermore a system for exploring the recovered traceability links will be developed.

\subsection{Road-map}
Section \ref{section:Motivation} motivates the topic of the thesis.
\ref{section:Background} gives a short overview over the necessary background information.
\ref{section:ResearchHypthesesAndQuestions} defines a preliminary hypothesis and formulates the research questions.
\ref{section:Objectives} specifies the important objectives for the thesis.
\ref{section:Methodology} describes the approach and methodology of the thesis.
Eventually \ref{section:StructureOfTheThesis} outlines the interim structure of the thesis.


\section{Motivation}
\label{section:Motivation}
A common task during the development of software systems is to persist and serialize a domain model.
For instance, consider a simple ReST-ful web-service where data is stored in a database and served via HTTP in serialized form, e.g. XML.
Given such a system, one can observe correspondences (structural similarities) and conformances (compliance with a definition) between different artifacts, i.e. manifestations of the same domain model.
Figure \ref{figure:ORXCorrespondenceBigPicture} shows a non exhaustive depiction of such relationships in O/R/X scenario.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{orx-correspondence-big-picture.png}
\\The depicted relationships may not be exhaustive.
\caption{O/R/X Correspondence \& Conformance}
\label{figure:ORXCorrespondenceBigPicture}
\end{figure}

Upon closer inspection, one can also observe that correspondence and conformance are not just interrelations of the artifacts as wholes.
In fact the same relations can be found between fragments of the artifacts.
Table \ref{table:ORXCorrespondenceExample} shows the fragments corresponding to a Java class property in the O/R/X scenario.

The motivating idea behind the thesis is that correspondence and conformance relationships between linguistic artifacts are trace-links left behind by transformations in the sense of \cite{DBLP:conf/sle/Lammel16}.
Thus, it should be possible to recover these links with a model describing these linguistic relations.
A technology capable of modeling such \textit{"linguistic architectures"}\cite{DBLP:conf/models/FavreLV12} is \megal\footnoteurl{http://www.softlang.org/megal/} \cite{DBLP:conf/ecmdafa/LammelV14}

\section{Background}
\label{section:Background}
The thesis will be based but is not limited to aspects of the following topics:

\begin{itemize}

\item
\textbf{Traceability}
The ability to interrelate artifacts of a software development process.
The automatic process of relating artifacts is called traceability recovery and the recovered relationships are called links.
Traceability support is one desired capability of \megal and serves as main subject of the thesis.

\item
\textbf{Megamodeling}
The process of interrelating models, e.g. relationships between models, meta-models, meta-meta-models up to meta*-models.
Megamodeling in the sense of \megal mainly interrelates software languages and kindred objects.

\item
\textbf{Ontologies}
The systematic modeling and representation of knowledge.
Megamodels as used in the thesis are in fact some sorts of software linguistic ontologies, so ontologies may be covered as related work.

\item
\textbf{Mereology}
The study of logic part-whole relationships \cite{DBLP:journals/dke/Varzi96}.
Merology serves as theoretical basis for modeling fragments of linguistic artifacts.

\item
\textbf{Program Analysis}
The process of automatically analyzing programs either statically, by analyzing source code, or dynamically by monitoring and intercepting the runtime of a program, i.e. analyzing transient artifacts.
Traceability recovery of linguistic links is in fact an application of program analysis.

\item 
\textbf{XML Data Binding}
The process of automatically mapping model- and instance-level objects into a XML-serialized form.
XML Data Binding as  implemented by JAXB\footnote{Java Architecture for XML Binding \url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/arch.html}} will serve as a scenario subjected to traceability recovery of linguistic links.

\item
\textbf{Object Relational Mapping}
The process of automatically mapping model- and instance-level objects into a relational data-storage.
Object Relational Mapping as implemented by JPA\footnote{Java Persistence API \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html}} and Hibernate\footnoteurl{http://hibernate.org/} will serve as onother scenario subjected to traceability recovery of linguistic links

%\subsection{Ontologies}

%
%\subsection{Mereology}
%Mereology is the systematic study of the relationships between wholes and part \cite{DBLP:journals/dke/Varzi96}.
%The core of its discourse is the Parthood- or \partOf-Relationship, which is axiomatized as follows:
%\begin{definition}[\partOf]
%We denote: "$x \partOf y$" and mean that $x$ is constituent of $y$.
%We assume that \partOf is
%\begin{itemize}
%\item reflexive: $x \partOf x$,
%\item antisymmetric: $x \partOf y \wedge y \partOf x \Rightarrow x = y$
%\item and transitive: $x \partOf y \wedge y \partOf z \Rightarrow x \partOf z$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}

%\subsection{Megamodelinng (with \megal)}
%\megal\footnoteurl{http://www.softlang.org/megal/} is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and technology designed  for modeling the linguistic architecture of software systems.
%It is actively developed by the Software Language Team\footnote{\url{http://www.softlang.org/}} at the University of Koblenz-Landau and currently has two implementations: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%\megalxtext an \eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
%\item
%and \megaltext a text-file and console based implementation with an 
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Program Analysis}
%Program Analysis is the process of automatically analyzing programs.
%This can be done (a) statically by analyzing the source code of a program or (b) dynamically through monitoring and intercepting the runtime of a program, analyzing transient artifacts. 
%
%\subsection{XML Data Binding (with JAXB)}
%XML Data Binding is the process of automatically mapping instance- and model-level objects into a XML-serialized form.
%That is, for the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)\footnoteurl{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/arch.html}, a Java class itself is mapped via annotations to an XML Schema, both model-level objects.
%With this mapping Java class-instances can easily be de-/serialized into XML Documents, a process called un-/marshaling.
%XML Data Binding allows to directly work with a domain model rather than working with direct XML access.
%
%\subsection{Object-Relational Mapping (with JPA/Hibernate)}
%Object-Relational Mapping is the process of automatically mapping instance- and model-level objects into a relational data-storage.
%In case of SQL-database technologies, model-level objects are mapped to SQL/DDL (Data Definition Language) statements and instance-level objects are mapped to SQL/DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements.
%Usually, these statements are then sent to and executed by a SQL-database server.
%This allows to directly work with a domain model when persisting data.
%
%The Java Persistence API (JPA)\footnoteurl{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jpa-137156.html} is a Java standard interface for working with Object-Relational Mapping.
%Hibernate\footnoteurl{http://hibernate.org/} is one of many JPA implementations.
%It provides annotations and a XML Schema for defining Object-Relational Mappings between Java classes and database tables.

\section{Research Hypotheses \& Questions}
\label{section:ResearchHypthesesAndQuestions}
Parthood is the relationship between a whole and its constituent parts.
\cite{DBLP:journals/dke/Varzi96} and \cite{DBLP:conf/sle/Lammel16} axiomatize it as a reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive relation:
\begin{align*}
&x \partOf x
\\&x \partOf y \wedge y \partOf x \Rightarrow x = y
\\&x \partOf y \wedge y \partOf z \Rightarrow x
\end{align*}
Correspondence is the relationship between two software artifacts who share a structural similarity.
\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/Lammel16} axiomatizes it as a strict one-to-one relation between software artifacts:
\begin{align*}
&(a_1,a_2) \in R \subseteq L_1 \times L_2
\\&\wedge \forall b_1 \in L_1 : b_1 \partOf a_1 \Rightarrow (\exists! b_2 \in L_2 : b_2 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_1 \correspondsToR{R} b_2 )
\\&\wedge \forall b_2 \in L_2 : b_2 \partOf a_2 \Rightarrow (\exists! b_1 \in L_1 : b_1 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_2 \correspondsToR{R} b_1 )
\\&\Rightarrow a_1 \correspondsToR{R} a_2
\end{align*}

Given an arbitrary relationship $R$ between to languages, for instance a transformation from one language to the other, two artifacts correspond to each other if and only if for each part of one artifact there exists exactly one corresponding part of the other.



Conformance is the relationship between two software artifacts, denoting that one artifact complies to the definition given by the other.
\cite{DBLP:conf/sle/Lammel16} axiomatizes it as follows:
\begin{align*}
\forall x \in \Any :
x \in L \subseteq \Any \Leftrightarrow \exists d \in D \subseteq \Any : x \conformsTo d
\end{align*}

Given a set $\Any$ serving as a universe for software artifacts, an arbitrary artifact conforms to another one if and only if the latter artifact is a definition for software language whom the former is an element of.

One objective of the thesis should be to provide empirical assurance for the axiom above in the sense that correspondence and conformance are in fact mereologically induced.
However, \cite{DBLP:conf/sle/Lammel16} also notes that strict correspondence may be unrealistic since real world artifacts may contain two or more parts corresponding to only one part in another artifact, e.g. an XSD documents can contain an element and a complex type definition corresponding to only on Java class declaration.
For this reason the thesis will assume a weaker forms of correspondence and conformance as research hypotheses:
\begin{enumerate}[RH1]
\item
\textbf{Fragment Correspondence Hypothesis}
\begin{align*}
&\forall a_1 \in L_1, a_2 \in L_2 \exists b_1 \in L_1, b_2 \in L_2 :  
\\&a_1 \correspondsToR{R} a_2
\Rightarrow 
b_1 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_2 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_1 \correspondsToR{R} b_2
\end{align*}
If two artifacts are assumed to correspond to each other, then parts of both artifacts should exist which also correspond to each other.

\item
\textbf{Fragment Conformance Hypothesis}
\begin{align*}
&\forall a_1 \in L, a_2 \in D \exists b_1 \in L, b_2 \in D : 
\\&a_1 \conformsTo a_2
\Rightarrow 
b_1 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_2 \partOf a_2 \wedge b_1 \conformsTo b_2
\end{align*}
If two artifacts are assumed to be in a conformance relationship, then parts of both artifacts should exist which share the same relationship.
\end{enumerate}






%Because the thesis will conduct empirical examination with real world artifacts, the hypothesis can be refined.
%two helpful predicates can be defined:
%\begin{align*}
%x \properPartOf y &:\Leftrightarrow x \partOf y \wedge \neg (y \partOf x)
%\\x \atomOf y &:\Leftrightarrow x \properPartOf y \wedge \neg \exists z(z \properPartOf x)
%\\x \fragmentOf y &:\Leftrightarrow x,y \in L \wedge x \properPartOf y
%\\x \atomicFragmentOf y &:\Leftrightarrow x,y \in L \wedge x \atomOf y
%\end{align*}
%\begin{align*}
%&a_1 \correspondsToR{R} a_2
%\wedge f_1 \atomicFragmentOf a_1
%\wedde f_2 \atomicFragmentOf a_2
%\\&\Rightarrow 
%(f_1, f_2) \in R
%\end{align*}
%where \properPartOf is a standard irreflexive parthood relationship from \cite{DBLP:journals/dke/Varzi96}, and \fragmentOf
%If two artifacts are in a Correspondence-Relationship, they contain constituent parts in the same relation to each other, i.e.:
%\begin{align*}
%&\forall a_1 \in L_1, a_2 \in L_2 (a_1 \correspondsToR{R} a_2
%\\&\Rightarrow
%\exists f_1, f_2: 
%f_1 \fragmentOf a_1 
%\wedge f_2 \fragmentOf a_2 
%\wedge f_1 \correspondsToR{R} f_2)
%\end{align*}
%\subsubsection{Fragment Conformance Hypothesis}
%If two artifacts are in a Conformance-Relationship, they contain constituent parts in the same relation to each other, i.e.:
%\begin{align*}
%&A_1 \conformsTo A_2
%\\&\Rightarrow
%\exists a_1, a_2: 
%a_1 \partOf A_1 
%\wedge a_2 \partOf A_2 
%\wedge a_1 \conformsTo a_2
%\end{align*}

\section{Methodology}
\label{section:Methodology}
Thesis and research will utilize an example-driven approach inspired by the 101system\footnoteurl{https://101wiki.softlang.org/101system}.
For this, the system to study will be an imaginary Human Resource Management System (HRMS).
Figure \ref{figure:TheCompanyModel} shows an UML-Class-Diagram depicting the model of this system.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{companies.png}
\caption{The Human Resource Management System Model}
\label{figure:TheCompanyModel}
\end{figure}

The HRMS will be implemented in plain Java with two scenarios in mind:
(a) XML-Binding with JAXB
and (b) Persitence with JPA/Hibernate.
Both scenarios will be studied with the concrete instance of the HRMS model depicted in figure \ref{figure:TheCompanyInstanceCalledSoftlangInc}.
