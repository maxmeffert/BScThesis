\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter summarizes functional requirements for the recovery system developed as part of this thesis.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Req.\arabic*},ref=Req.\arabic*]

\item
\label{Requirement:Parthood-Links}
The recovery system must be capable of recovering parthood links, i.e. links capturing the relation between syntactically well-formed software artifacts and their fragments.

\item
\label{Requirement:Correspondence-Links}
The recovery system must be capable of recovering correspondences links, i.e. links capturing the relation between fragments of software artifacts denoting a predefined similarity among them and their fragments.

\ToDo{refer to a correspondence definition}

\item
\label{Requirement:Conformance-Links} 
The recovery system must be capable of recovering conformance links, i.e. links capturing the relation between a software artifacts or fragments denoting that one defines the other.

\ToDo{refer to a conformance definition}

\item 
\label{Requirement:Megal-Xtext}
The recovery system must be capable of running within the \megalxtext environment, i.e. the implementations of requirements \ref{Requirement:Parthood-Links}, \ref{Requirement:Correspondence-Links} and \ref{Requirement:Conformance-Links} must be compatible with the \megalxtext plug-in-system.

\end{enumerate}
