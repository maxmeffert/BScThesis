\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:Background}
This chapter summarizes the necessary background topics of the thesis.
Each topic is introduced as independent as possible, interrelation is done during synthesis of hypotheses for this thesis in chapter \ref{chapter:Hypotheses}.
However, some of the following sections are sorted in a way that one may be based on its predecessor.
In particular sections on the necessary mathematical background share definitions.
Introducing them repeatedly would be redundant.
